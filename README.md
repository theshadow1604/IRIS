# IRIS Classification
Iris Flower classification model
Developed a straightforward machine learning model to effectively
categorize iris flowers into three distinct species by leveraging their
characteristic features, including sepal length, sepal width, petal
length, and petal width. Proficiently utilized Python for program‑
ming, employed Pandas for data handling, and utilized scikit‑learn to
construct and assess the model.
